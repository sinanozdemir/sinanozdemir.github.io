We also need to find where the jump occurs when the our exe file is loaded. First, let's restart the debugger and look for loaded modules:

![Mona Modules](monaModules.png)

We need to know the hex value of JMP command so we can look for it within gatekeeper.exe:

![JMP Command](nasmJMP.png)

We don't see any other DLLs being used by gatekeeper.exe so let's look for JMP command in our program:

![Mona JMP](monaJMP.png)

As we can see we have two candidates:
```bash
0x080414c3
0x080416bf
```
In the next step, we can try the first base address to see whether or not we can own EIP.
