Thank you to [the GOAT, Heath Adams](https://github.com/hmaverickadams) for being the true cyber mentor and [The Mayor, Joe Helle](https://github.com/dievus?tab=repositories) for being an inspiration in this community.

I have decided to break down BOF attack into two programming languages, Python and Ruby:

1. [BOF with Python](bofPython.md)
2. [BOF with Ruby](bofRuby.md)

Now, let's see all these templates in action. 
We'll be exploiting a machine called [Gatekeeper on TryHackMe.com](https://www.tryhackme.com/room/gatekeeper), this room is free and created by [The Mayor, Joe Helle](https://github.com/dievus?tab=repositories). In order to use this room, you need to join THM. We'll be using both Python and Ruby templates to exploit this machine and get the root/system level access. Alright, let's dive in...

1. [Gatekeeper Recon](GatekeeperRecon.md)
- [Spiking with Python](ExploitingBOFWithPythonSpiking.md)
- [Finding the Offset with Python](ExploitingBOFWithPythonOffset.md)
- [Overwriting the EIP with Python](ExploitingBOFWithPythonOverWriteEIP.md)
- [Finding Badchars with Python](ExploitingBOFWithPythonBadChars.md)
- [Finding the Right Module](ExploitingBOFWithPythonFindingModule.md)
